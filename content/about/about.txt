text: The mushroom naturally grows on the stumps of the Chinese Hackberry tree (Celtis sinensis, "enoki" in Japanese), but also on other trees, such as ash,[which?] mulberry and persimmon trees. There is a significant difference in appearance between the wild and cultivated types of the mushroom.

Cultivated mushrooms have not been exposed to light, resulting in a white color, whereas wild mushrooms usually display a dark brown color. Cultivated mushrooms are grown in a carbon dioxide (CO2)-rich environment to nurture the development of long thin stems, whereas wild mushrooms produce a much shorter and thicker stem.

The wild variety of the mushroom may be found from September through to March, hence the name Winter Fungus.
